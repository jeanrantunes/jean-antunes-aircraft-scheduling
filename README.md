# Aircraft scheduling

You can check this app over this [link](https://jeanrantunes.github.io/jean-antunes-aircraft-scheduling).

## Rules

- You must choose an aircraft before choose the flights;
- Aircrafts must be on the ground at midnight, so you can NOT choose a flight after midnight;
- The turnaround time is always 20min for our airline;
- Aircrafts cannot "teleport" and cannot move without operating a flight, which means the origin of the flight to be added must be the same of last added flight;
